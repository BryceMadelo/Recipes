        <h2>Steps in Making Shrimp Scampi Pasta</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep ahead:</li>
            <p align="justify">Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating your skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze, or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving recipe. If you use fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp earlier in the day, then keep it chilled in the refrigerator until you're ready to get cooking.</p>
            <li>Cook the pasta first:</li>
            <p align="justify">Before preparing the shrimp scampi, cook the pasta in salted water, drain it, and set it aside. Before serving, you will add the pasta to a heated skillet to reheat it. You don't want the pasta to sit for too long, so make sure you're ready to start boiling the shrimp shortly after the pasta is drained.</p>
            <li>Don't overcook the shrimp:</li>
            <p align="justify">Raw shrimp takes only a few minutes to cook, and if they are cooked for too long, they become tough and rubbery. When the shrimp begin to coil into a C shape and transform from transparent gray to opaque pink and white, they are nearly done.</p>
        </ol>
